        <p>Triton Town enable the people around the world to control the robot remotely. It is simple for people to 
				  try and learn from the process. 
				</p>
				<p>Our team is focusing on the remote control part. Our team divided the vistors
				   into three classes. One is pure vistors. Our website would show them a video and tutorial to help them
						understand our project quickly. Then for the users, a upload and test page is added for them to simulate
						 their algorithm. As for the administrator, new function to add and delete is added.
